# What üöÄ

A simple application created with ReactJS. In this application, users, their posts and user details are called from API endpoints. In order to make a better structure, some libraries are used. The main goal of this project is challenging and measuring my technical skills for the job opportunities.

# Some Notes  ‚úçÔ∏è

- Due to disabled billing account on Google Maps API, map service is not working optimizated. So, [Google Maps Places Search] according to address isn't used here.
- If result data would had latitude and longitude data, I would mark the user coordinates on map.
- PageNotFound page has been added, except for the documentation.
- app-id has been hidden because of the security cases with dotenv. If you want to run the application on your machine. Please get your own app-id from https://dummyapi.io/
